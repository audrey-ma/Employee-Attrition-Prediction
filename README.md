## Introduction

Human resource analytics is crucial for understanding workforce dynamics and improving organizational outcomes. This project employs clustering algorithms to explore patterns in employee data, focusing on areas like attrition, performance, and engagement.

## Objectives

* Identify key employee clusters based on demographic and behavioral attributes.
* Provide actionable insights to improve employee retention and satisfaction.
* Assess and visualize the performance of various clustering models.

## Data Overview

The dataset used in this project includes anonymized HR metrics, such as:

* Demographic Information
* Job Role and Satisfaction
* Attrition Rate
* Performance Scores

## Methods

The following techniques were employed:

* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
* Clustering Algorithms:
    * K-Means
    * Hierarchical Clustering
    * DBSCAN
* Evaluation Metrics: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and more.
* Visualization: PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.

## Results and Insights

Key findings include:

* [Add high-level insights here, e.g., "Employees with higher engagement scores were less likely to leave the company."]
* Visual representations of clusters revealed distinct employee groups.

* Add performance graphs and tables here, such as:
    * A bar chart comparing silhouette scores across models.
    * A scatter plot showing clustered data in reduced dimensions.
    * A table summarizing evaluation metrics for each algorithm.
